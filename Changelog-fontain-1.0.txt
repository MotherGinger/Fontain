fix versioning and tag as release


--------------------

Steffen Buehl:
	- add version to toc
	- fix "Attempt to access forbidden object from code tainted by an AddOn" for 6.0.2
Chris Heald:
	- Re-enable the damage text and unit name settings, since I've discovered it takes a relog, not a reload to enable them
	- Update the TOC
	- Fixes for borked libraries
	- Add Calibri
	- Initial commit.
